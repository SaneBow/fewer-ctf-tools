# Fewer CTF Tools

## About this list

### Why?

I know, I know. There already exists some perfect lists, like [this](https://github.com/apsdehal/aWEsoMe-cTf) and [this](https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools), but those lists are **too perfect**. I mean they almost include every tool you can find online. If you are a beginner like me, you may spend a lifetime trying and learning each of them. Even if don't need them all, say if you only need the tool for a specific type of CTF puzzle, you may find yourself spending a lifetime choosing among similar tools.

### What's in this list:

**One** tool for each category of CTF puzzles that are **commonly** seen. 

This list tries to make the chosen tool the most powerful and representative one for solving particular type of CTF puzzle.

### What will not be included in this list:

- Alternative tools for a particular type of CTF puzzle that is similar to the listed tool. (e.g. ZAP and Burpsuite)
- Tools for specific topics that are not so common in CTF. (e.g. PDF analysis tools)
